			            <p>Minnesota born and raised by a family involved in many different areas of entertainment, city planning, carpentry, teaching, and much more. Music is a big part of my background and will continue to play a roll throughout the rest of my life. It is my goal to continue learning as much as possible, no matter the field, in order to help others on their own path.</p>

			<article class="values"><h3>Values</h3>
				Understanding that all fields are bound together by those you have networked with, I have done my best to be a part of many projects in several different areas of study. The ability to ask what needs to be done and have the tools necessary to either find the path to the answer or to take care of it immediately is key. It is not in being the best leader, but the best teammate that will win any competition in business or otherwise. Truly the greatest form of art is helping others cultivate their own. These are some of my values and what has brought me to where I am today. Pursuing the field of coding is finding the means to bring different forms of work together into one coherent, easily accessible, interesting, inspiring place for anyone to view, use, and share.
